# py_scripts
Contains small python scripts as I keep learning

## dictionary.py
This script shows webscraping in python using BeautifulSoap4 package. It can be executed to find meaning of a work. The script scraps data from dictionary.com.

**Usage**
This script accepts one argument, that is, word. 

It has exception handling hence it is error proof.

## life.py
This is a very simple python scripy that shows simplicity (may be hard to get) ;)
